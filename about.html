    <h1 class="header">About Amelia</h1>
    <p class="about">Since 2017, Amelia has done more than read Tarot. 
      She has refined her unique approach to an age-old divinatory art 
      to become a catalyst for her clients’ self-discovery and growth.
      As a Mexican-American queer woman, Amelia brings a blend of 
      cultural perspective, intuition, empathy, and her multi-disciplinary 
      background as a writer and creative to her readings. 
      She is passionate about helping individuals harness the 
      transformative power of Tarot to navigate life’s twists and turns 
      with clarity, courage, and compassion. Each reading is a collaborative 
      journey, where we explore the currents of energy beneath the surface of life,
      illuminating the path forward toward a more fulfilling future.</p>
    <p class="about">Amelia is a Brooklyn-based Tarot reader, writer, and creative with a strong background 
      in traditional esoteric practices. From a Mexican-American cultural background, Amelia grew up around Tarot, 
      spiritual concepts, and folk magic. She is a Scorpio Sun, Leo Moon, and Virgo Rising, positioning her 
      as a simultaneously analytic and empathic mind within an intuitive context. 
      She lives in Williamsburg with her boyfriend and cat and is currently working on many creative projects, 
      including a debut urban fantasy novel based on Mexican folklore.</p>
