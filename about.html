    <h1>About Amelia</h1>
    <p>Since 2017, Amelia has done more than read Tarot. 
      She has refined her unique approach to an age-old divinatory art 
      to become a catalyst for her clients’ self-discovery and growth.
      As a Mexican-American queer woman, Amelia brings a blend of 
      cultural perspective, intuition, empathy, and her multi-disciplinary 
      background as a writer and creative to her readings. 
      She is passionate about helping individuals harness the 
      transformative power of Tarot to navigate life’s twists and turns 
      with clarity, courage, and compassion. Each reading is a collaborative 
      journey, where we explore the currents of energy beneath the surface of life,
      illuminating the path forward toward a more fulfilling future.</p>
