      Since 2017, Amelia has done more than read Tarot. 
        She has refined her unique approach to an age-old divinatory art 
        to become a catalyst for her clients’ self-discovery and growth.

    As a Mexican-American queer woman, Amelia brings a blend of cultural perspective, 
        intuition, empathy, and her multi-disciplinary background as a writer and creative to her readings. 
        She is passionate about helping individuals harness the transformative 
        power of Tarot to navigate life’s twists and turns with clarity, courage, and compassion. 
        Each reading is a collaborative journey, 
        where we explore the currents of energy beneath the surface of life, 
        illuminating the path forward toward a more fulfilling future.</div>
